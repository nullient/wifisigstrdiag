Wireless Signal Strength Diagnostics
====================================
This app shows the signal strength and other info for a chosen Wi-Fi access point.

Simply enter the name of a Wi-Fi access point (you can use * for wildcards), and press 'Go' to start a scan. Once the scan completes, you'll see various information about the matched Wi-Fi network(s), grouped by band/BSSID. You can also perform multiple scans to get a more accurate reading, by calculating the average (mean), median, min or max of the collected signal strength levels.
